						Hi. My name is Noah Hartzell-Jordan. 
						I was one of the founding members of the Titanium Tigers and was captain and lead programmer for the first three years. 
						I am very proud of the team that I have built and I know they will continue to grow. 
						I will come back as a mentor while I am at NC state university for their engineering program. 
						The titanium tigers will have a hard time getting rid of me.
